% CREATE DATASHEETS The example shows how to instantiate and configure a datasheetGenerator class object to create 
% characteristic plots and datasheets for joint model classes. The example is based on the parameter sets of the 
% *TREE Actuators* <www.treerobotics.eu>.

%% Build joint model classes
% A model of a TREE Robotics Pomegranate actuator with 9 kNm/rad sensor stiffness Coulomb friction as well as
% electric dynamics including winding inductance and rigid gearbox.
