%ELECTRIC_DYN_DQ Get compute nonlinear dynamics for the electrical
%subsystem with a d-q axis current model
%
% [x_dot, tau_m] = electric_dyn_dq(jointObj, x, u)
%
% Inputs::
%   jointObj: instance of the joint class object for which this function
%             has been called.
%   x:        Current state vector x = [i_q, i_d]'
%   u:        Input voltages v_q, v_d, and motor velocity q_m_dot, given as
%             u = [v_q, v_d, q_m_dot]
%
% Outputs::
%   x_dot:    State derivative
%   tau_m:    Generated motor torque
%
%
% Notes::
% When this model is used for simulation, it may require very small
% sampling times that prolong the computation time for the simulation. If
% the d-axis is not important one may refer to electric_dyn instead, and if
% the electrical transients may be neglected, refer to the
% electric_dyn_zero_inductance model.
%

% Examples::

% Author::
