%ELECTRIC_DYN_ZERO_INDUCTANCE Get linear dynamics matrices for the
%electrical subsystem when inductance can be ignored
%
% [A, B, C, D] = electric_dyn(jointObj)
%
% jointObj is the instance of the joint class object for which this
% function has been called. Alternatively, it can be called for joints
% which were built with these dynamics as:
% [A, B, C, D] = jointObj.getElectricalDynamicsMatrices()
%
% Outputs::
%   A:   System matrix
%   B:   Input matrix
%   C:   Output matrix
%   D:   Direct Feedthrough matrix
