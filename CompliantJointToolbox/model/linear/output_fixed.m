%OUTPUT_FIXED Get linear dynamics matrices - output link fixed
%
% [A, B, C, D, I, R, K] = jointObj.output_fixed
%
% jointObj is the instance of the joint class object for which this
% function has been called.
%
% Outputs::
%   A:   System matrix
%   B:   Input matrix
%   C:   Output matrix
%   D:   Direct Feedthrough matrix
%   I:   Inertia matrix
%   R:   Damping matrix
%   K:   Stiffness matrix
%
% Notes::
%  This function is identical to full_dyn, but with the difference that the
%  joint output is now considered to be fixed. This leads to a reduced
%  model structure by an order two. Instead of environmental torque acting
%  on the load, the load motion becomes a velocity input.

function [A, B, C, D, I, R, K] = output_fixed(obj)
    
    % The computations below assume a state vector definition according to:
    % x = [q_m, q_g, q_l, q_m_dot, q_g_dot]', where
    % q_m is the motor angle,
    % q_g is the gearbox output angle
    % q_l is the load angle
    %
    % The '_dot' denotes the temporal derivative.

    % NOTE
    % The size of I, R, K needs to be identical, square, and the number of
    % rows needs to equal the number of derivatives in the state x.
    % This is important for the construction of B_nonlinear in
    % mask_JointMechanicalSubsystem.
