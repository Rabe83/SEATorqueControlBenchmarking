function [A, B, C, D, I, R, K] = rigid(obj)
    
    % The computations below assume a state vector definition according to:
    % x = [q_l, q_l_dot]', where 
    % q_l is the flange angle (output of the torsion bar)
    %
    % The '_dot' denotes the temporal derivative.
    
    % NOTE
    % The size of I, R, K needs to be identical, square, and the number of
    % rows needs to equal the number of derivatives in the state x.
    % This is important for the construction of B_nonlinear in
    % mask_JointMechanicalSubsystem.
    
    % Inertia matrix
    I = obj.I_m + obj.I_g + obj.I_l;

    % Damping matrix
    d_m = obj.d_m;

    d_l = obj.d_l; % shorthands %#ok<*PROP>

    % There is no stiffness (rigid joint)
    K = 0;

    A = [   zeros(size(I)),     eye(size(I));

    % Output
    C = [   1,  0;      % motor position
            1,  0;      % gear position
