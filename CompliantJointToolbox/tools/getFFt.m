% GETFFT Perform Fast Fourier Transform on a signal.
% =========================================================================
%
% [f, amp] = getFFt(t, sig)
%
%  Description:
%    Time and signal vector must have equal length. Time steps are assumed
%    to be equidistant.
%
%  Inputs::
%    t:      Time vector
%    sig:    Signal vector
%
%  Outputs::
%    f1: vector of single-sided frequencies in Hz (0..fs/2)
%    amp: single-sided amplitude spectrum
