function [ outSum ] = cjtComputeChecksum( input)
%CJTCOMPUTECHECKSUM Compute checksum of files or data.
%   The implementation of this function reuses existing code. Since
%   the actual function used might change, this function is a wrapper to
%   decouple code.
%
%   outSum = cjtComputeChecksum(input)
%
%   input: numeric array, character array, file path
%   outSum: character array containing the checksum corresponding to the input
%
% Notes::
%   If 'input' is a path to an existing file on the path, the checksum will
%   be computed for that file. Otherwise the checksum will be computed for
%   the corresponding character array.
