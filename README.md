# Getting Started
Before running the torque control simulations

1) Download the Compliant Joint Toolbox from "https://github.com/geez0x1/CompliantJointToolbox"
2) Move "SEA_model.m" file into "\CompliantJointToolbox\examples\matlab" location
3) Move "sea_param.m" file into "\CompliantJointToolbox\param" location
4) run "setCJTPaths.m" file which is inside the "Compliant Joint Toolbox" file.
5) Then run  "SEA_model.m" file which is located in "CompliantJointToolbox\examples\matlab"

After these steps you can run each simulation in simulink.
