%ELECTRIC_DYN Get linear dynamics matrices for the electrical subsystem
%
% [A, B, C, D] = electric_dyn(jointObj)
%
% jointObj is the instance of the joint class object for which this
% function has been called. Alternatively, it can be called for joints
% which were built with these dynamics as:
% [A, B, C, D] = jointObj.getElectricalDynamicsMatrices()
%
% Outputs::
%   A:   System matrix
%   B:   Input matrix
%   C:   Output matrix
%   D:   Direct Feedthrough matrix
%
% Notes::
% When this model is used for simulation, it may require very small
% sampling times that prolong the computation time for the simulation.
% In the case where motor current transients are not important, they may be
% neglected by using the electric_dyn_zero_inductance model instead.
